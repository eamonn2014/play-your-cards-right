### Info

*Purpose*:   
In the TV program Play Your Cards Right players are dealt one card face up and several cards face down from a standard pack of 52 cards. They then have to guess whether the next card
is higher or lower than the overturned card. Get it right and
the game continues. Get it wrong, or turn over the same card of a
different suit, and the game ends.

Here we limit the game to three cards. We examine the scenario in which the player always keeps the first card and the scenario in which the player always replaces the first card dealt. Instead of using a standard playing card deck we use the numbers 1 to 13 and have 4 copies to mimic a deck of cards.

The question is, what is the probability that both your guesses are correct? 

For example, a Jack is represented by card value 10. There are then 9x4=36 cards lower than the
Jack, there are 51 cards unseen, so the probability that the first mystery card is lower than a Jack can be calculated as 36/51 ≈ 70.6%.


*Method*:  
An explanation for the scenario in which a card is dealt and not switching is explained [here](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

We expand upon this for our question, and evaluate for all possible scenarios for the first card (remembering we have thrown a particular card away).

We are dealt a card of your choosing [2nd box on left] and always discard it to replace it with a random card and two mystery cards. The question is what is the probability that both your guesses are correct.

### Info

*Purpose*:   
In the TV program Play Your Cards Right players are dealt one card face up and several cards face down from a standard pack of 52 cards. They then have to guess whether the next card
is higher or lower than the overturned card. Get it right and
the game continues. Get it wrong, or turn over the same card of a
different suit, and the game ends.

Here we limit the game to three cards and always replace the first card we are dealt. 
Instead of using a standard playing card deck we use the numbers 1 to 13 and have 4 copies to mimic a deck of cards.

We are dealt a card of your choosing [2nd box on left] and always discard it to replace it with a random card and two mystery cards. The question is what is the probability that both your guesses are correct. 

For example, a Jack is represented by card value 10. There are then 9x4=36 cards lower than the
Jack, there are 51 cards unseen, so the probability that the first mystery card is lower than a Jack can be calculated as 36/51 ≈ 70.6%.


*Method*:  
An explanation for the scenario in which a card is dealt and not switching is explained here. We expand upon this for our question, and evaluate for all possible scenarios for the first card (remembering we have thrown a particular card away).    


*Notes*:
